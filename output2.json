            "correct_answer": "** First, do not touch the victim with bare hands while they are still in contact with the live conductor. If possible, switch off the power supply to break the contact. If that is not feasible, use dry non-conducting materials (like a wooden bar, rope, or any dry article of clothing) to safely remove the victim from the live conductor. Ensure you are standing on insulating material (like dry wood or rubber) to avoid electric shock yourself. Once the victim is free, check their breathing and pulse, and if they are unconscious but breathing, place them in the recovery position and call for medical assistance.",

            "correct_answer": "** The immediate first aid measures for severe bleeding include making the patient lie down and rest to prevent shock. If possible, raise the injured part above the level of the body to reduce blood flow to the area. Apply direct pressure on the wound to control the bleeding, squeezing the sides of the wound together if necessary. Call for professional medical assistance. Once the bleeding has stopped, cover the wound with a clean dressing and secure it with a bandage. If the bleeding is very severe, apply more than one dressing without removing the initial one.",

            "options": null,
            "correct_answer": "** When treating burns caused by direct flame or chemical, it is crucial to exclude air from the burn area to relieve pain. For large burns, do not apply any treatment other than covering the area with water, clean paper, or a clean shirt to cool the burn and protect it from air exposure. Avoid applying ointments or creams. If the burn is extensive, seek professional medical help immediately, as large burns can lead to serious complications.",

            "options": null,
            "correct_answer": "** For an eye injury caused by hot flying particles, do not rub the eye, as this can cause further damage. Instead, flush the eye gently with clean water or saline solution to remove any foreign particles. If irritation persists, mild eye drops may be used, applying 2 to 3 drops several times a day. However, if a metal chip or slag particle has entered the eye, it is critical to take the injured person to an eye doctor immediately for professional treatment. Do not apply any eye drops or ointments without consulting a medical professional.",

            "options": null,
            "correct_answer": "** The severity of an electric shock is influenced by several factors, including the level of current passing through the body, the duration of contact, the age of the person, whether they are wearing insulating footwear, weather conditions, and the wetness of the floor. Higher current levels can lead to severe pain, muscle contractions, and potentially fatal heart fibrillation. These factors necessitate a prompt and careful first aid response, including immediate disconnection from the power source, monitoring of the victim's breathing and pulse, and ensuring that the victim is kept warm and comfortable while waiting for professional medical assistance.",
